The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and a pandemic in March 2020. As of 22 November 2020, more than 58.2 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 1.38 million deaths attributed to COVID-19.
COVID-19 spreads via a number of means, primarily involving saliva and other bodily fluids and excretions. These fluids can form small droplets and aerosols, which can spread as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks. This is suspected to be the main mode of transmission. The virus may also spread via fomites (contaminated surfaces) and direct contact.[8][9] Infection mainly happens when people are near each other long enough.[b] It can spread as early as two days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from asymptomatic (no symptoms) individuals. People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases.

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The incubation period is typically around five days but may range from one to 14 days.[13] There are several vaccine candidates in development, although none has completed clinical trials. Although work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is currently symptomatic.[14]

Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing a face mask in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.

The responses have caused global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[15] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption and food shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Educational institutions have been partially or fully closed. Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media. There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.

Although it is still unknown exactly where the outbreak first started, several early infected people had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, located in Wuhan, Hubei, China.[17] On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease "COVID-19", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.[18][19] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[20] pangolin coronaviruses,[21][22] and SARS-CoV.[23] The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin.[24][25] The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.[26]

The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[27][28] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[29][30][31] There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[32] 
Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.[33][34] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[35][36] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.[37] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.[38][39]

On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.[40] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.[41][42] Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies shown that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.[43] Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.[44]

Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.[45] It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.[46] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.[47]

Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[48] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[49] R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.
Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.[52] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.[53] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.[54][55] This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[56] The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[57] The first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[58] and the first reported death outside Asia was in the United States on 6 February.[59]

More than 95% of the people who contract COVID-19 recover. Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[60] As of 22 November 2020, more than 1.38 million[5] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. People at the greatest risk from COVID-19 tend to be those with underlying conditions, such as a weakened immune system, serious heart or lung problems, severe obesity, or the elderly.[61]

On 24 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States changed the criteria for attributing deaths to COVID-19 to include those marked "probable"/"likely." The CDC said, "It is not likely that [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)] will follow up on these cases" and that while the "underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate, … the rules for coding and selection of the ... cause of death are expected to result in COVID–19 being the underlying cause more often than not."[62]

On 16 April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) created two codes for classifying deaths: UO7.1, "confirmed by laboratory testing irrespective of severity of clinical signs or symptoms"; and UO7.2, "diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available". The WHO "recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation… will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code COVID-19 provisionally to code U07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'."[63][64] It was also noted that the WHO "does not distinguish" between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.[65]

Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.[66] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[67][68][69] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[70] Countries like Belgium include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.[71]

The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.4 percent (1,382,745 deaths for 58,274,308 cases) as of 22 November 2020.[5] The number varies by region.
The most important metric in assessing death rate is the infection fatality ratio (IFR),[74][c] which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals infected (including all asymptomatic and undiagnosed) to-date.[76] In March, a peer-reviewed analysis of pre-serology data from mainland China yielded an overall IFR of 0.66% (with age-bracketed values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9 years to 0.595% for 50–59 years to 7.8% for > 80 years).[77]

In April 2020, an IFR range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed serology surveys, with the upper bound characterized as much more credible and the range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).[78]

In July 2020, the US CDC adopted the IFR as a "more directly measurable parameter for disease severity for COVID-19" and computed an overall 'best estimate' for planning purposes for the U.S. of 0.65%.[79][80] In September, the CDC computed an age-bracketed 'best estimate' for the U.S. of 0.003% for 0–19 years; 0.02% for 20–49 years; 0.5% for 50–69 years; and 5.4% for 70+ years.[81][d]

In August 2020, the WHO reported serology testing for three locations in Europe (with some data through 2 June) that showed IFR overall estimates converging at approximately 0.5-1%.[75] A systematic review article in The BMJ advised that "caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance" and called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of "RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures."[82][83] CEBM researchers have called for in-hospital 'case definition' to record "CT lung findings and associated blood tests"[84] and for the WHO to produce a "protocol to standardise the use and interpretation of PCR" with continuous re-calibration.[85]

In September 2020, a Bulletin of the World Health Organization article by John Ioannidis estimated global IFR inferred from seroprevalence data at 0.23%[e] overall and 0.05% for people < 70 years, much lower than estimates made earlier in the pandemic. Ioannides criticized prior "average IFR … irresponsibly circulated widely in media and social media" as "probably extremely flawed as they depended on erroneous modeling assumptions, and/or focused only on selecting mostly studies from countries high death burden (that indeed have higher IFRs), and/or were done by inexperienced authors who used overtly wrong meta-analysis methods in a situation where there is extreme between-study heterogeneity.[86] As the data for his analysis was drawn "predominantly from hard-hit epicenters", Ioannides indicates that even lower "average values of 0.15–0.25% … and 0.03–0.04% for <70 years) as of October 2020 are plausible."[86][87] He also notes that in European countries with a large numbers of cases and deaths[88] and in the U.S.,[89] "many, and in many cases most, deaths occurred in nursing homes".[90]

On 6 October 2020, Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme announced "Our current best estimates tell us that about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus."[91] Also in October, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) reported a 'presumed estimate' of global IFR at between 0.10% to 0.35%, noting that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.[92] These researchers noted a decrease in IFR in England over time;[93][f] and, for the UK and Italy (the two Europeans nations worst hit by COVID-19), attribute the rise in daily cases, stability in daily deaths, and shift of cases to a younger population to waning viral circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus mutation.
Another metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio (CFR),[g] which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date. This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more severe symptoms).[65] On 4 August, WHO indicated "at this early stage of the pandemic, most estimates of fatality ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude methods, giving rise to widely variable estimates of CFR by country – from less than 0.1% to over 25%."
COVID-19 spreads from person to person mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or breathes. A new infection occurs when virus-containing particles exhaled by an infected person, either respiratory droplets or aerosols, get into the mouth, nose, or eyes of other people who are in close contact with the infected person.[95][96] Respiratory droplets may evaporate into droplet nuclei, which remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time. Long distance airborne transmission has been shown to occur in hospital wards. Airborne transmission has been demonstrated in healthcare settings, with certain aerosol-generating medical procedures performed on COVID-19 patients,[97][98] and regularly occurs in crowded and inadequately ventilated indoor spaces, such as restaurants, nightclubs or choirs.[96][97]

Kissing, physical intimacy, and other forms of direct contact can easily transmit the virus and thus lead to COVID-19 in people exposed to such contact.[97][99] A person can get COVID-19 through indirect contact by touching a contaminated surface or object before touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes,[97] though this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.[96] There is currently no significant evidence of COVID-19 virus transmission through feces, urine, breast milk, food, wastewater, drinking water, animal disease vectors, or from mother to baby during pregnancy, although research is ongoing and caution is advised.[97][99]
It can be transmitted as early as two days before developing symptoms, and even if symptoms never appear.[96][100] People remain infectious in moderate cases for 7–12 days, and up to two weeks in severe cases.[100] In October 2020, medical scientists reported evidence of reinfection in one patient.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.[102][103][104]

Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.[105] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.[104] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.
COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest.[118][119]

On 29 September 2020, a letter in Lancet highlighted the increasing likelihood of overestimating of COVID-19 incidence as more asymptomatic people are included in RT-PCR testing with consequent "misdirection of policies regarding lockdowns and school closures," noting that the false-positive rate in the UK is currently unknown, with "preliminary estimates … somewhere between 0·8% and 4·0%".[120][121] The letter called for "stricter standards … in laboratory testing, … and pretest probability assessments … [including] symptoms, previous medical history of COVID-19 or presence of antibodies, any potential exposure to COVID-19, and likelihood of an alternative diagnosis."
The standard test for presence of SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is possible to test other samples. This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[123] As this test detects RNA but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited."[124] Positive tests have been shown not to correlate with future excess deaths.[125]

A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.[126] Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.[127]

On 22 June 2020, UK health secretary Matt Hancock announced the country would conduct a new "spit test" for COVID-19 on 14,000 key workers and their families in Southampton, having them spit in a pot, which was collected by Southampton University, with results expected within 48 hours. Hancock said the test was easier than using swabs and could enable people to conduct it at home.[128]

The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence[129][130] that "a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing"[131] On 7 September, the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results."[132]

In October 2020, the US diplomats and security officials raised a warning for Las Vegas against the use of Chinese test kits donated by the United Arab Emirates. In partnership with Group 42, Nevada was receiving donations of hundreds of thousands of test kits costing from between $15 million to $20 million, which raised concerns around patient privacy and test accuracy. Earlier, there were doubts that UAE's Group 42 could get access to US citizens through test data.[133][134]

In November 2020, research showed that breath analysis could make the "rapid identification" in seconds for coronavirus possible.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[138][139][140] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[141][142] Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.[143]

The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10.[144] On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.[145] A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.[140]

Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.[146][147]

In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance. The use of the term "social distancing" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means.[148][149] Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
The WHO and US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[152][153][154] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.[153][155] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.[153][155] Face coverings also filter out viral particles from inhaled air, reducing the chance that the wearer will become infected.[156] Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.[157][158]

Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[159] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[160] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.[160] Healthcare professionals interacting directly with COVID-19 patients are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.[161] 
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[163][164]

Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations.[165][166] The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.[167] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[105][168][169] 
The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health recommends that COVID-19 has made the maintenance of one's immune system more important than ever. Therefore, eating a healthy diet, being physically active, managing psychological stress, and getting enough sleep are critical.[170] Dark-skinned people are at particular risk of a vitamin D deficiency which can impair the immune system.[171]
Hand hygiene is extremely important to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.[175] The US CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[176] In addition, soap and water disrupts the sticky bond between pathogens and human skin which causes the coronavirus pathogen to slide off the hands/body.[177] CDC has recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.[160] The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[138][178] It is not clear whether washing hands with ash, if soap is not available, is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections.[179]
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.[180] Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used.[173] The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[181]
 A COVID‑19 vaccine is any of several different vaccine technologies intended to provide acquired immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Previous work to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus diseases SARS and MERS established knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses, which accelerated development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms for a COVID‑19 vaccine.[182]

On 4 February 2020, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar published a notice of declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID‑19, covering "any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID‑19, or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the declaration precludes "liability claims alleging negligence by a manufacturer in creating a vaccine, or negligence by a health care provider in prescribing the wrong dose, absent willful misconduct".[183] The declaration is effective in the United States through 1 October 2024.

On 9 November, Pfizer Inc announced that its vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19,[184] and on 16 November, Moderna revealed its vaccine was 94.5% effective.[185] 
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.[190] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.[191] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.[192]

Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.[186] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.[186] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.[193]

More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.[194] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised the hoarding of medical supplies.[195]

Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.[192] 
Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.[196] The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.[197]

Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.[197] (Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)[197]

On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography.[198][199] The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms.[200] In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.[201] 
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.[202] The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.[202][203] In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.[204][205][206]

Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.[207][208] In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.[209][210][211] On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing. NASA is seeking fast-track approval.[212][213] 
Antiviral medications are under investigation for COVID-19, though none have yet been shown to be clearly effective on mortality in published randomised controlled trials.[214] Emergency use authorisation for remdesivir was granted in the U.S. on 1 May 2020, for people hospitalised with severe COVID-19.[citation needed] In September 2020, following a review of later research, the WHO recommended that remdesivir not be used for any cases of COVID-19, as there was no good evidence of benefit.[215] In severe cases, the use of corticosteroids can reduce the risk of death.[215]

Taking over-the-counter cold medications,[216] drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.[160] Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.[217] The safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a treatment option requires further research.[218]

Other trials are investigating whether existing medications can be used effectively against COVID-19 or the immune reaction to it.[214][219] On 16 June 2020, the RECOVERY Trial group released a statement that their preliminary results show low dose dexamethasone reduces mortality in patients receiving respiratory support,[220] though previous reviews had suggested the use of steroids may worsen outcomes.[221] Demand for dexamethasone surged after publication of the preprint.[222] On 2 September 2020, the WHO recommended treatment with systemic steroids for patients with severe and critical symptoms, but continued to advise against their use for other patients.[223]

A study of major hospitals in the U.S. found that abnormal liver tests occurred in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes.[224] Tocilizumab was significantly associated in the relationship between the drugs used to treat the disease and abnormal liver tests, which prompted studies to determine whether abnormal results were due to coronavirus or drug-induced liver injury, according to Michael Nathanson, director of the Yale Liver Center and co-author of the study.[225]

On 9 November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients.Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system's ability to fight off harmful antigens such as viruses. Bamlanivimab is a monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, designed to block the virus' attachment and entry into human cells.[226]

On 19 November 2020, the FDA issued an EUA for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).[227] The data supporting the EUA for baricitinib combined with remdesivir are based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ACTT-2), which was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).[227] The EUA was issued to Eli Lilly and Company.[227] 
Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.[229][230] A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.[231] On 30 October 2020 WHO chief Tedros has warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects". He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning." They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings and other symptoms. Tedros has underlined that therefore herd immunity is "morally unconscionable and unfeasible".[232]

In terms of hospital readmissions about 9% of 106,000 individuals had to return for hospital treatment within 2 months of discharge. The average to readmit was 8 days since first hospital visit.There are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility. Among these are advanced age (above 65 years of age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.
Based on the retrospective analysis, starting from December 2019, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December and at least 266 by 31 December.[235] That same day, the WHO received reports of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of an unknown cause in Wuhan,[236] and an investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.[237]

According to official Chinese sources, these early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[238] However, in May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak.[239]

On 24 December 2019, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[240] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[241]

On 30 December 2019, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3 January),[242] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours; and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[243] That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".[244] The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause, confirming 27 cases[236][245][246]—enough to trigger an investigation.
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[247] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[248] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[249] A retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later)[250] and more may have been infected.[251] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".[29][252]

On 30 January 2020, with 7,818 confirmed cases across 19 countries, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC),[253][254] and then a pandemic on 11 March 2020[255][256] as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported increasing numbers of cases. Later that month, the number of cases outside of China quickly surpassed the number of cases inside China.[citation needed]

On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.[257] As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[258] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths.[259] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[260] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[261] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019[262][263] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[264]

On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case being officially reported,[265] the city of Beijing reported a single COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.[266] As of 15 June 2020, 79 cases were officially confirmed.[267] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.[265][268]

On 29 June 2020, WHO warned that the spread of the virus is still accelerating as countries reopen their economies, although many countries have made progress in slowing down the spread.[269]

On 15 July 2020, one COVID-19 case was officially reported in Dalian in more than three months. The patient did not travel outside the city in the 14 days before developing symptoms, nor did he have contact with people from "areas of attention."[270]

In October 2020, the WHO stated, at a special meeting of WHO leaders, that one in ten people around the world may have been infected with COVID-19. At the time, that translated to 780 million people being infected, while only 35 million infections had been confirmed.[271]

In early November 2020, Denmark reported on an outbreak of a unique mutated variant being transmitted to humans from minks in its North Jutland Region. All twelve human cases of the mutated variant were identified in September 2020. The WHO released a report saying the variant "had a combination of mutations, or changes that have not been previously observed."[272] In response, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ordered for the country – the world's largest producer of mink fur – to cull its mink population by as many as 17 million.[273]

On 9 November 2020, Pfizer released their trial results for a candidate vaccine, showing that it is 90% effective against the virus.[274] Later that day, Novavax entered an FDA Fast Track application for their vaccine.[275] The November 9 announcement does not mean the vaccine is about to be released. However, virologist and U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci indicated that the Pfizer vaccine targets the spike protein used to infect cells by the virus. Some issues left to be answered are how long the vaccine offers protection, and if it offers the same level of protection to all ages. Initial doses will likely go to healthcare workers on the front lines.[276]

On 9 November 2020 the United States surpassed 10 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, making it the country with the most cases worldwide by a large margin.[277]

As of 22 November 2020, more than 58.2 million cases have been reported worldwide due to COVID-19; more than 1.38 million have died and more than 37.3 million have recovered.[5] 
A total of 191[5] countries and territories have had at least one case of COVID-19 so far. Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.[278] National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).[279] The WHO's recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that they should be short-term measures to reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health workers who are exhausted. To achieve a balance between restrictions and normal life, the long-term responses to the pandemic should consist of strict personal hygiene, effective contact tracing, and isolating when ill.[280]

By 26 March 2020, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown,[281] which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world's population.[282][283]

By late April 2020, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.[284] Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States,[285] around 100 million people in the Philippines,[284] about 59 million people in South Africa,[286] and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.[287][288] On 21 May 2020, 100,000 new infections occurred worldwide, the most since the start of the pandemic, while overall 5 million cases were surpassed.[289] 
As of 30 April 2020,[290] cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan and North Korea, although these countries likely also have cases.[291][292] Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly Mongolia,[293] South Korea,[294] Taiwan,[295] and Vietnam,[296] has allowed them to fare comparatively well. 
As of 14 July 2020, there are 83,545 cases confirmed in China— excluding 114 asymptomatic cases, 62 of which were imported, under medical observation; asymtomatic cases have not been reported prior to 31 March 2020—with 4,634 deaths and 78,509 recoveries,[297] meaning there are only 402 cases. Hubei has the most cases, followed by Xinjiang.
The first case of COVID-19 in India originated from China and was reported on 30 January 2020. India ordered a nationwide lockdown for the entire population starting 24 March 2020,[299] with a phased unlock beginning 1 June 2020. Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country—Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[300]

As of September 2020, India had the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia;[301] and the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world,[302] behind the United States,[303] with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May 2020,[304] 1,000,000 on 16 July 2020,[305] and 5,000,000 confirmed cases on 16 September 2020.[306] On 30 August 2020, India surpassed the US record for the most cases in a single day, with more than 78,000 cases,[307] and set a new record on 16 September 2020, with almost 98,000 cases reported that day.

On 10 June 2020, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.[308] As of 30 August 2020, India's case fatality rate is relatively low at 2.3%, against the global 4.7%.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people had died that day.[311][312] Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events,[313] sporting events,[314] Friday prayers,[315] and closures of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.[316] Iran allocated 5 trillion rials (equivalent to US$120,000,000) to combat the virus.[317] President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.[318] Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March 2020,[319] although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.[320] Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March.[321][322]

Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China during February 2020.[323][324] More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.[324][325] The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 March 2020.[326] On 15 March 2020, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began.[327] At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March 2020.[328] By 23 March 2020, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.[329] According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported. It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.[330] On 20 April 2020, Iran reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country.[331] After reaching a low in new cases in early May, a new peak was reported on 4 June 2020, raising fear of a second wave.[332] On 18 July 2020, President Rouhani estimated that 25 million Iranians had already become infected, which is considerably higher than the official count.[333] Leaked data suggest that 42,000 people had died with COVID-19 symptoms by 20 July 2020, nearly tripling the 14,405 officially reported by that date.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China. The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February,[335] largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.[335][336] Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.[337][338] By 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms.[339] South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.[340] On 29 February, more than 3,150 confirmed cases were reported.[341] All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus.[337] Airline schedules were also changed.[342][343]

South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them.[294][344] Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application,[345] drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day,[346] and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.[347] Despite some early criticisms of President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis,[348] South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.[294][349][350]

On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.[347] On 29 March it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.[351] Per media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.[352] Persistent local groups of infections in the greater Seoul area continued to be found, which led to Korea's CDC director saying in June that the country had entered the second wave of infections,[353] although a WHO official disagreed with that assessment.


As of 13 March 2020, when the number of new cases became greater than those in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) began to consider Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[355][356] Cases by country across Europe had doubled over periods of typically 3 to 4 days, with some countries (mostly those at earlier stages of detection) showing doubling every 2 days.[357]

As of 17 March, all countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with Montenegro being the last European country to report at least one case.[358] At least one death has been reported in all European countries, apart from the Vatican City.

As of 18 March, more than 250 million people were in lockdown in Europe.[359]
As of 24 May, 68 days since its first recorded case, Montenegro became the first COVID-19-free country in Europe,[360][361] but this situation lasted only 44 days before a newly imported case was identified there.[362]

On 21 August, it was reported the COVID-19 cases were climbing among younger individuals across Europe.
Although it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux, it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples.[262][263] A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse, which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.[364][365]

On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places,[366] and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until 11 May.[367][368][369] As of 14 September, France has reported more than 402,000 confirmed cases, 30,000 deaths, and 90,000 recoveries,[370] ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases.[371] In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs.[372] On 18 May, it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups.[373]

On 12 November it was reported that France had become the worst hit country by the COVID-19 pandemic, in all of Europe, in the process surpassing Russia. The new total of confirmed cases was more than 1.8 million and counting; additionally it was indicated by the French government that the current national lockdown would remain in place.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.[257] Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.[375] An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.
On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy.[377] Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas."[378][379]

On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths. All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April,[380] but on 9 March all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.[381] On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.[382][383]

On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols.[384][385][386] On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic.[387][388] On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.[389] As of 14 September, there were 287,753 confirmed cases, 35,610 deaths, and 213,634 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.[5] A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate.[390] On 19 April, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses are asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown.[391] On 13 October 2020, the Italian government again issued restrictive rules to contain a rise in infections.[392]

On 11 November, it was reported that Silvestro Scotti, president of the Italian Federation of General Practitioners indicated that all of Italy should come under restrictions due to the coronavirus. A couple of days prior Filippo Anelli, president of the National Federation of Doctor's Guilds (FNOMCEO) asked for a complete lockdown of the peninsular nation due to the pandemic.[393] On the 10th, a day before, Italy surpassed 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases.
The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera, Canary Islands.[395] Post-hoc genetic analysis has shown that at least 15 strains of the virus had been imported, and community transmission began by mid-February.[396] By 13 March, cases had been confirmed in all 50 provinces of the country.

A lockdown was imposed on 14 March 2020.[397] On 29 March, it was announced that, beginning the following day, all non-essential workers were ordered to remain at home for the next 14 days.[398] By late March, the Community of Madrid has recorded the most cases and deaths in the country. Medical professionals and those who live in retirement homes have experienced especially high infection rates.[399] On 25 March, the official death toll in Spain surpassed that of mainland China.[400] On 2 April, 950 people died of the virus in a 24-hour period—at the time, the most by any country in a single day.[401] On 17 May, the daily death toll announced by the Spanish government fell below 100 for the first time,[402] and 1 June was the first day without deaths by coronavirus.[403] The state of alarm ended on 21 June.[404] However, the number of cases increased again in July in a number of cities including Barcelona, Zaragoza and Madrid, which led to reimposition of some restrictions but no national lockdown.[405][406][407][408]
Studies have suggested that the number of infections and deaths may have been underestimated due to lack of testing and reporting, and many people with only mild or no symptoms were not tested.[409][410] Reports in May suggested that, based on a sample of more than 63,000 people, the number of infections may be ten times higher than the number of confirmed cases by that date, and Madrid and several provinces of Castilla–La Mancha and Castile and León were the most affected areas with a percentage of infection greater than 10%.[411][412] There may also be as many as 15,815 more deaths according to the Spanish Ministry of Health monitoring system on daily excess mortality (Sistema de Monitorización de la Mortalidad Diaria - MoMo).[413] On 6 July 2020, the results of a Government of Spain nationwide seroprevalence study showed that about two million people, or 5.2% of the population, could have been infected during the pandemic.[414][415] Spain is the second country in Europe (behind Russia) to record half a million cases.[416] On 21 October, Spain passed 1 million COVID-19 cases, with 1,005,295 infections and 34,366 deaths reported as of 21 October a third of which occurred in Madrid.
Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open.[418] Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency's policy favoured forgoing a lockdown. The Swedish strategy focused on measures that could be put in place over a longer period of time, based on the assumption that the virus would start spreading again after a shorter lockdown.[419][420] The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.[418][421] On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day.[422] In the end of June, Sweden no longer had excess mortality.
Devolution in the United Kingdom meant that each of the four countries of the UK had its own different response to COVID-19, and the UK government, on behalf of England, moved quicker to lift restrictions.[424] The UK government started enforcing social distancing and quarantine measures on 18 March 2020[425][426] and was criticised[by whom?] for a perceived lack of intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.[427][428] On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised against non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.[429][430] On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments to close as soon as possible,[431] and promised to prevent unemployment.[432] On 23 March, Johnson banned gatherings of multiple people and restricting non-essential travel and outdoor activity. Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through fines and dispersal of gatherings. Most unessential businesses were ordered to close.[433]

On 24 April it was reported that a promising vaccine trial had begun in England; the government pledged more than £50 million towards research.[434] A number of temporary critical care hospitals were built.[435] The first operating was the 4000-bed NHS Nightingale Hospital London, constructed for over nine days.[436] On 4 May, it was announced that it would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities;[437] 51 patients had been treated in the first three weeks.[438]

On 16 April it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 million doses in the UK would be available.
The first cases in North America were reported in the United States in January 2020. Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on 25 March, and in all North American territories after Bonaire confirmed a case on 16 April.[440]
Canada reported 117,658 cases and 3,842 deaths on 30 July, while Mexico reported 416,179 cases and 46,000 deaths.[441] The most cases by state is Texas with about 17,279 deaths and over 849,000 confirmed cases.
As of November 2020, there were more than 12,000,000 confirmed cases and 255,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S., representing nearly one-fifth of the world's known COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the most cases and deaths of any country.[442] As of November 20, the U.S. death rate had reached 770 per million people, the thirteenth-highest rate globally.[443][444]

The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China,[445][446] but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing for the virus.[447][448][449][h] Meanwhile, President Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under control.[451]

The first known American deaths occurred in February, but were not known to be caused by COVID-19 until April.[452] By mid-April, cases had been confirmed in all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and all inhabited U.S. territories, except American Samoa. However, on November 9, American Samoa reported its first three cases, meaning that all inhabited U.S. jurisdictions now have confirmed cases of the virus.[453][454]
On March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency.[455] The Trump administration largely waited until mid-March to start purchasing large quantities of medical equipment.[456] In late March, the administration started to use the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment.[457] By April 17, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and territories. A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states.
The pandemic was confirmed to have reached South America on 26 February 2020 when Brazil confirmed a case in São Paulo.[460] By 3 April, all countries and territories in South America had recorded at least one case.[461]

On 13 May, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of infection with 23,091 deaths. On 22 May, citing especially the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the WHO declared South America the epicentre of the pandemic.[462][463]
As of 20 September,[needs update] South America has about 7.5 million confirmed cases and 238,000 deaths. Due to a dearth of testing and medical facilities, it is believed that the outbreak is far larger than the official numbers show.
On 20 May it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities. With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States.[465] On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro has created a great deal of controversy referring to the virus as a "little flu" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines. His attitude towards the outbreak has so closely matched that of President Trump he has been called the "Trump of the Tropics".[466] Bolsonaro later tested positive for the virus.[467]

In June 2020, the government of Brazil attempted to conceal the actual figures of the COVID-19 active cases and deaths, as it stopped publishing the total number of infections and deaths. On 5 June, Brazil's health ministry took down the official website reflecting the total numbers of infections and deaths. The website was live on 6 June, with only the number of infections of the previous 24 hours. The last official numbers reported about 615,000 infections and over 34,000 deaths.[468] On 15 June, it was reported that the worldwide cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one week, citing Latin America, specifically Brazil as one of the countries where cases are surging, in this case, towards 1 million cases.[469] On 10 November, it was reported that health authorities in Brazil had stopped clinical trials of a Chinese-developed COVID-19 vaccine, the director of Brazil's Butantan biomedical institute indicated that adverse effects that had been reported were not linked to the actual clinical trial.
The pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Africa on 14 February 2020, with the first confirmed case announced in Egypt.[471][472] The first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa was announced in Nigeria at the end of February.[473] Within three months, the virus had spread throughout the continent, as Lesotho, the last African sovereign state to have remained free of the virus, reported a case on 13 May.[474][475] By 26 May, it appeared that most African countries were experiencing community transmission, although testing capacity was limited.[476] Most of the identified imported cases arrived from Europe and the United States rather than from China where the virus originated.[477] It is believed that there is widespread under-reporting in many African countries with less developed healthcare systems.
The pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.[479] It has since spread elsewhere in the region,[480] although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. Six Oceania sovereign states have yet to report a case: Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Australia and New Zealand have been praised for their handling of the pandemic compared to other western nations, with the latter wiping out all community transmission of the virus. The most recent country or territory to report its first confirmed case was Samoa, on 18 November 2020.
As a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas,[481] or for all travellers.[482] Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector. Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.[483] A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions.[484] Researchers concluded that "travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late".[485]

The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy,[486][487] a decision which has been criticised by some European politicians.
Owing to the effective lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance. Canada, the United States, Japan, India,[490] Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.[491] Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people.[492][493] On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk.[494] Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China.[495]

On 15 February, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess,[496] and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship.[497] In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran.[498][499] On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
The United Nations response to the pandemic has been led by its Secretary-General and can be divided into formal resolutions at the General Assembly and at the Security Council (UNSC), and operations via its specialized agencies.[citation needed]

In June 2020, the Secretary-General launched its 'UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19'.[501] The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNSC) has been criticized for a slow coordinated response, especially regarding the UN's global ceasefire, which aims to open up humanitarian access to the world's most vulnerable in conflict zones.
The WHO is a leading organisation involved in the global coordination for mitigating the pandemic.

The WHO has spearheaded several initiatives like the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund to raise money for the pandemic response, the UN COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force, and the solidarity trial for investigating potential treatment options for the disease.
In responding to the outbreak, the WHO has had to deal with political conflicts between member states, in particular between the United States and China.[503] On May 19, the WHO agreed to an independent investigation into its handling of the pandemic. On August 27, the WHO announced the setting up of an independent expert Review Committee to examine aspects of the international treaty that governs preparedness and response to health emergencies.
